# 0x07.Networking Basics - DevOps and Network

This project covers the basics of networking, including the OSI model, different types of networks, and common networking protocols. It also includes practical tasks involving regular expressions and Bash scripting for network operations.

## Tasks

### OSI Model
- **File**: `0-OSI_model`
- **Description**: Understanding the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and its 7 layers.

### Types of Networks
- **File**: `1-types_of_network`
- **Description**: Differentiating between LAN (Local Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network), and the Internet.

### MAC and IP Address
- **File**: `2-MAC_and_IP_address`
- **Description**: Learning about MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses.

### UDP and TCP
- **File**: `3-UDP_and_TCP`
- **Description**: Understanding the differences between UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).

### TCP and UDP Ports
- **File**: `4-TCP_and_UDP_ports`
- **Description**: Writing a Bash script that displays listening ports, showing the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

### Is the Host on the Network
- **File**: `5-is_the_host_on_the_network`
- **Description**: Creating a Bash script that pings an IP address to check if a host is online.

## Usage

Each directory contains a specific task file. To execute the scripts, you may need to grant execution permissions using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x <script_name>
```
place <script_name> with the actual name of the script you want to execute.
